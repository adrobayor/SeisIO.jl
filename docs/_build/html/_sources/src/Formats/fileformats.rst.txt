Format Descriptions and Notes
=============================

**miniSEED**: SEED stands for Standard for the Exchange of Earthquake Data. miniSEED is a SEED variant format that contains only data packets. [#]_

**SAC**: a fast, straightforward format developed for the Seismic Analysis Code application, supported by virtually every programming language. [#]_ [#]_ [#]_

**SEG Y**: data format used by the Society for Exploration Geophysicists\ :sup:`(a)` [#]_

**P-SEG Y**: A modified SEG Y format developed by PASSCAL/New Mexico Tech. [#]_

**UW**: the University of Washington data format was designed for event archival. A UW event is described by a pickfile and a corresponding data file, whose names are identical except for the last character, e.g. 99062109485o, 99062109485W.\ :sup:`(b)`

**Win32** : data format developed by the NIED (National Research Institute for Earth Science and Disaster Prevention), Japan. Data are typically divided into files that contain a minute of continuous data from channels on a single network or subnet; data within each file are stored by channel as variable-precision integers in 1s segments. Channel information for each stream is retrieved from a channel information file.\ :sup:`(c)` [#]_ [#]_

Usage Warnings
--------------
:sup:`(a)`  SEG Y is supported up to and including rev 1. Trace header fields in SEG Y are not rigidly defined by any central authority, only "recommended". As such, industry SEG Y files may be unreadable. This issue is widely known, not correctable, and by no means endemic to SeisIO.

:sup:`(b)`  No online documentation for the UW data format is known to exist. Please contact the SeisIO creators if additional help is needed to read these files.

:sup:`(c)`  Win32 channel information files are not synchronized by any central authority, date stamped, or automatically maintained; thus, inconsistencies in channel parameters (e.g. gains) are possible. Please remember that redistribution of Win32 files is strictly prohibited by the NIED.


.. **********
.. Batch Read
.. **********
.. The function ``batch_read`` speeds up file read for SAC and SEG Y data using shared arrays and efficient parallelization. Currently only provides a slight speedup due to Julia v0.6 slowing parallelization with @async; slated for rewrite.
..
..
.. Usage
.. =====
.. ::
..
..   @everywhere using SeisIO
..   S = batch_read(FILESTR, ftype=FMT, fs=FS)
..
.. Read files matching FILESTR of format FMT and resample to ``FS`` Hz. If ``FS`` isn't specified, files are resampled to match fs of the first file read.
..
.. ``FILESTR`` supports wildcards in file names, but not directory names.
..
..
.. Supported Keywords
.. ------------------
.. .. csv-table::
..   :header: kw, type, description
..   :delim: |
..   :widths: 8, 8, 24
..
..   ftype | String  | File type. Choose one of ``"SAC"`` (default, SAC) or ``"PASSCAL"`` (P-SEG Y).
..   fs    | Float64 | Resample to ``fs`` Hz. By default, batch_read uses ``fs`` from the first file read.
